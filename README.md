<h3>Summary</h3>
A portfolio website directing visitors towards my code (Github), videos (Youtube), and art (personal art portfolio).

<h3>Purpose</h3>
Built for the PICO-8 Game Quest in UVA’s CS 4730: Computer Game Design under the theme “Into the depths.” Grade: 100/100.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
Developed on the PICO-8 fantasy console. Programmed the update & draw loop in Lua, writing the full game loop (collision physics, scoring, animation) from scratch. Sprites and SFX were created with PICO-8’s built-in editors.

<h3>Skills Learned</h3>

- Game Architecture: Implemented the full update/draw loop and structured core game state logic.

- Physics & Collision Systems: Built custom bounce mechanics with friction, damping, and precise edge detection.

- Difficulty Balancing & Game Feel: Tuned gameplay responsively through iterative playtesting and feedback.

- Sprite & Sound Design: Created original visuals and audio using PICO-8’s built-in editors.

- UI/UX Design: Communicated game states clearly through intuitive visual and interaction cues.

- Effects & Animation Systems: Authored custom particle effects to enhance feedback and moment-to-moment impact.
