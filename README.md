<h3>Summary</h3>
A portfolio website directing visitors towards my code (Github), videos (Youtube), and art (personal art portfolio).

<h3>Purpose</h3>
Built to highlight my work across a variety of mediums and websites.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
This portfolio is built with Next.js and React, styled using Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theme support. The focus is an interactive 3D logo rendered with Three.js that loads a GLB model and features smooth orbit controls with auto-rotation that pauses during user interaction and gradually resumes. The 3D scene includes theme-aware materials that automatically switch between white (dark mode) and light gray (light mode) based on the user's system preferences, and the entire component is optimized for performance with client-side rendering, proper memory cleanup, and Retina display support.
